--------

This program was originally written at ETH Zuerich 2003-2007 by
Sebastian Moedersheim, Boris Koepf, and Paul Hankes Drielsma, and
published under the BSD license in 2007.

This current version includes updates and new modules written by
Sebastian Moedersheim at the IBM Zurich Research Lab in 2007-2009 and
is also under BSD.

--------

To compile, you need the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (tested on version
6.12.1) as well as the lexer and parser generators for Haskell, Alex
and Happy; it is recommended to install the Haskell platform from
http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/ which includes everything you
need.

Have fun!

Sebastian Moedersheim
