Protocol: ISO_onepass_symm # Verified & Certified

# Note that this protocol has a trivial replay attack.  We thus
# specify only weak authentication as goal (not considering replay).
# The FP-module of OFMC currently does not handle injective
# authentication

Types: Agent A,B;
       Number NA,Text1;
       Function sk

Knowledge: A: A,B,sk(A,B);
	   B: B,A,sk(A,B)

Actions:
A->B: {|NA,B,Text1|}sk(A,B)

Goals:
B weakly authenticates A on Text1
