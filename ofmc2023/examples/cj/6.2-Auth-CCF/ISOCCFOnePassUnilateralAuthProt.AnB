Protocol: ISO_onepass_CCF # Verified 

# Note that this protocol has a trivial replay attack.  We thus
# specify only weak authentication as goal (not considering replay).
# The FP-module of OFMC currently does not handle injective
# authentication

Types: Agent A,B;
       Number NA,Text1,Text2;
       Function sk,f

Knowledge: A: A,B,sk(A,B),f;
	   B: B,A,sk(A,B),f

Actions:
A->B: NA,B,Text2,f(sk(A,B),NA,B,Text1),NA,B,Text1

Goals:
B weakly authenticates A on Text1
